## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-12 17:00

**Hardening: the §9 rate limit, the adversarial pass, the documentation sync.**

### Added

- **The rate limit on `POST /api/convert`** — 60 requests per minute per client IP via `@fastify/rate-limit`, scoped to the one WRITING endpoint (`global: false`, the per-route `config.rateLimit`); the 429 answers in the unified error shape (`RATE_LIMITED` + `errors.rateLimited` — the last unused catalog key comes alive, the §3 catalog closes at 100 % utilization) through a dedicated `RateLimitExceededError` and the central handler, declared in the OpenAPI contract. The keying: `trustProxy: 1` resolves `request.ip` to the viewer IP CloudFront appends — a client-forged `x-forwarded-for` prefix is ignored (the review pinned the hop count 2; the forged-prefix TEST corrected the off-by-one — the socket counts as hop 0). The limiter counts in `onRequest`, BEFORE validation — invalid requests trip it with zero statistics writes. The README documents the honest scope: per-instance counting (N×60 with N instances, the concurrency cap of 10 as the backstop), abuse damping rather than a security boundary.
- **The DI-injectable rate-limit max** (`BuildAppDeps.rateLimitMax`) — the 429 tests run four requests on their own app instance instead of sixty-one against the shared suite window (the human's review finding: the in-memory store makes the limiter's own test its adversary).
- **The frontend 429 handling — zero code** — the two-level error mapping already routes `RATE_LIMITED` to the banner and the catalog has carried the text since v0.2.0; an additive test proves it.
- **The observable stale fallback** (the adversarial pass) — `createCachedSource` gains an `onStaleServed` observer and the provider warns through the injected app logger: an OER outage is now visible in the logs while the cache still answers, instead of surfacing only when it dies into the 502 (rule 24 — the absorbed failure was the one silent catch in the system).
- **The supported-list race closed** (the adversarial pass) — an `UnknownRateCurrencyError` escaping between the supported-currencies check and the rate lookup (a TTL refetch can shrink the set mid-request) now maps to the same 422 `UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCY` instead of a 500; §3's "an external failure never ends as a 500" holds on every path.
- **The edge-case test deliverable** — the exact amount boundaries (`MAX_AMOUNT` inclusive, the first value above it, 0, the 2-vs-3-decimals line), the half-open `[0, ttl)` cache window, the honest-0-cents statistics write, the per-IP keying, the forged-prefix rejection, the before-validation counting; on the web the untested non-unified mutator fallback (a gateway HTML page, a transportless timeout → `NETWORK_ERROR`/`errors.network`) and the `errorPlacement` default branches. Tests: api 119 (+16), web 46 (+5).

### Changed

- **`docs/AI_SETUP.md` synced to reality** — §3 now shows the CURRENT committed `settings.json` (the exit-2 multi-workspace typecheck hook that replaced the original dead `|| true` loop, the monorepo deny additions) and §8 the real repo tree; the document no longer presents the v0.0.0 draft as the present.
- **The proposal gains the `## 15. Backlog` section** (rule 25 referenced it; now it exists) — the per-conversion event log (from v0.6.0) and the result-magnitude precision limit found by the adversarial pass (the input is bounded by 1e12, the result is not — cents beyond 2^53 lose precision at absurd magnitudes; documented, not fixed: a fix means a contract change).

### Fixed

- **A stale JSDoc in `web/src/api/mutator.ts`** claimed the synthetic NETWORK_ERROR carries `errors.internal` — it has carried `errors.network` since v0.10.0.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-12 16:15

**Level 2 functionally complete: the frontend completion and the same-origin production.**

### Added

- **The statistics live in the Result card** — the three assignment statistics in the Figma label+value style with the 1 px divider: the count (`formatCount`), the top target currency and the EUR total (`formatMoney`); loaded at the boot and **refreshed after every successful conversion** — the user watches the persistence live. The §10 empty state shows honest zeros; a fetch failure renders dashes and silently retries with the next refresh — the converter never blocks.
- **The language changer** — centered ABOVE the title on both breakpoints (the human's UX decision — the planned corner placement collided with the title on mobile); the codes come from the server list, a click switches instantly, persists to localStorage and updates `<html lang>`.
- **The two-level error mapping** — the code picks the family, the KEY picks the placement (the human's review finding): the amount keys at the field, `sameCurrency`/`invalidCurrencyCode` and the 422 at the selects, the generic 400 at the form, the provider/network failures as the page-level banner; everything translated by `key` with `params`, everything `role="alert"`.
- **`errors.network` in the catalog** — the synthetic transport error gets an honest text instead of blaming the server via `errors.internal`; a data addition through `/api/init`, zero OpenAPI change.
- **The announced in-flight state** — the Convert button carries `aria-busy` with the inline `role="status"` spinner (a visual-only spinner is silence for a screen reader); the fixed Figma button width prevents the layout shift.
- **The form defaults** — 0/EUR/CZK (the human's UX decision): the pristine `0` is NOT submittable (the positive-amount validation also closes a latent 0.9.0 gap where "0" reached the API as a 400) and is fully selected on focus — including after a mouse click, where the caret placement at mousedown would have collapsed the selection (a real UX bug the new test caught).
- **The same-origin production** — `sst.aws.Router` (`/api`, `/docs`, `/health` → the Function URL) + `sst.aws.StaticSite` as the default; one CloudFront URL, no CORS in production, `VITE_API_URL` empty in the build (the 0.9.0 mutator fallback IS this design).
- **Tests** — api 103, web 41 (16 new): the statistics formats/empty/failure/refresh, the language switch, the placements (structural in/out-of-form assertions), the aria-busy announcement, the defaults including the select-all-survives-the-mouse behavior.

### Changed

- **`/api/stats` and `/health` actively send `Cache-Control: no-store`** (the human's review finding): behind the CloudFront Router a MISSING header is an instruction vacuum a default TTL may fill — and a cached stats endpoint would invisibly break the refreshed-after-every-conversion behavior; §3 amended, the v0.6.0 absence-asserting test updated under the rule-29 carve-out.
- **The H1 centering** — guaranteed on every viewport (a 0.9.0 defect on non-desktop devices; the design always said centered).

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-12 14:39

**Level 2 starts: the frontend base.**

### Added

- **The monorepo move** — the API lives in `api/` (`git mv`, history preserved); the root keeps the repo-wide artifacts; the SST paths shifted to `../api/…` exactly as the v0.7.0 review planned; the CI api job runs in its working directory; the PostToolUse hook needed NOTHING — the v0.0.0 audit fix waited for exactly this moment.
- **`web/` — the React 19 + Vite frontend base**: strict TS with the api-grade lint rules, the design tokens in `_tokens.scss` taken VALUE BY VALUE from the committed Figma export (`docs/figma/style`), both layouts (the 920 px grid switch), Roboto self-hosted.
- **The generated API client** — orval from `api/openapi.json` into the committed `web/src/api/generated/` (`axios-functions`, every call through the custom mutator with the explicit `VITE_API_URL ?? ''` same-origin fallback and the `ErrorCode`/`key` error mapping); the CI web job guards the client drift and the build.
- **The boot and i18n** — the full-page phase until `/api/init` + `/api/currencies`; i18next under the pinned no-fallback trio (`fallbackLng: false`, a THROWING `parseMissingKeyHandler`, `returnEmptyString: false`); the §10 language chain (localStorage → browser → en); the single hardcoded string is the init-failure fallback; a currencies failure offers a translated retry.
- **The converter** — the Figma form card with react-hook-form (the EXPLICIT Convert action, double-submit prevention, a comma decimal accepted), two own-implementation ARIA comboboxes (filter/arrows/Enter/Esc/outside-click, the mutual currency exclusion) and the Result card with the reserved space; `formatMoney`/`formatCount` as the custom deterministic Figma-literal formatters (a regular U+0020 space — see Fixed).
- **CORS for the local web dev** — `@fastify/cors` with the exact `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` (never `*`), registered outside production only; `ui.retry` joined the §3 catalog (§10 demands a retry option and the catalog lacked its label).
- **Tests** — api 101 (+2 CORS), web 25 new: the boot phases, the form including the validation block and the translated API error, the combobox behaviors and the exclusion, the format literals (the U+0020 assertion), the mutator base-URL fallback and the error mapping, the language chain.

### Fixed

- **The OpenAPI document was technically invalid since v0.2.0** — the recursive `z.lazy` translation-tree schema serialized as a dangling `$ref` (`#/components/schemas/schema0`); Swagger UI silently tolerated it, orval (the first REAL consumer of the contract) refused. The schema is now bounded to the fixed §3 catalog depth — and a deeper tree fails the response serializer loudly instead of hiding.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-12 13:47

**The milestone: Level 1 of the assignment complete, including both bonuses (the deploy + IaC).**

### Added

- **The production deploy and the live URL** — the production stage deployed by the human from the existing SST config (zero application-code change); the full live verification sweep passed: the health diagnostics, the ETag/304 revalidation, the first live OER call (172 currencies — the secret works), a real conversion with the full-precision rate and the once-rounded result, the validation and 422 catalogs over HTTP, the statistics written to and read from the production DynamoDB, the Swagger UI including its copied assets, and the unified 404.
- **README.md** — the complete rule-17 structure: the badges (the live GitHub Actions CI badge instead of a hardcoded test count — it cannot go stale), the request-flow diagram with the documented trade-offs (the §4 cache-vs-OER-limit math, the §6 counters-not-event-log decision, the per-stage isolation), the API reference with the `rateTimestamp` semantics and the error-model table, the Quick Start (local + AWS) with the rule-27 env-variable table, the documentation links, the project status, the tech stack, the AI-collaboration section and the honest unlicensed status (revisited at 1.0.0).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-12 13:21

### Added

- **The SST v4 infrastructure (`deploy/`)** — its own npm project with the single `sst` dependency (the no-sharing principle); `sst.config.ts` with the per-stage DynamoDB table (dev conversions never pollute production), the `OerApiKey` secret (the key lives in SST secrets, never in the repo) and the Function with `url: true` and `link` (IAM least privilege — exactly its one table); the region eu-central-1.
- **The Lambda parameters as documented decisions** — `nodejs22.x` (matches the pinned local Node), 512 MB (CPU scales with memory), a 10-second timeout (above the 5-second OER fetch budget — a slow OER ends as a controlled stale/502, never a Lambda kill), the concurrency cap of 10 via the account-level quota; every value carries its why-comment in the config.
- **The Lambda adapter (`src/lambda.ts`)** — the §2 twin of `server.ts`: `@fastify/aws-lambda` around `buildApp()`, nothing else; the app stays blind to its hosting (configuration exclusively from env vars, `DYNAMO_ENDPOINT` unset = the AWS mode).
- **The §8 esbuild traps solved** — the Swagger UI assets ship via `copyFiles` from the ROOT `node_modules` (the `../` crosses the deploy/ module boundary) and `resolveSwaggerStaticDir()` hands the plugin an explicit `baseDir` on Lambda (the ESM pattern: `import.meta.url` + `fileURLToPath` — no `__dirname`, no `cwd()`); the i18n JSONs were statically imported since v0.2.0.
- **Tests** — 4 new (99 total): both branches of the swagger resolver (the module-relative path, the injectable check) and the offline Lambda smoke test through a **Function URL payload-format-2.0 fixture** (`url: true` never sends the API GW v1 shape) — `/health` 200 with the §3 shape and the unified 404 through the adapter.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-12 13:02

### Added

- **The statistics module (`src/stats/`)** — the §6 model: one table, atomic counters, no event log. Every conversion writes ONE `TransactWriteItems` with two `Update ADD`s (the global `conversionCount`/`totalEurCents` + the per-target counter) — both succeed or neither does, the global count can never drift from the target sum; no read before write.
- **`GET /api/stats`** — the persistent totals: `totalConversions` (a nonnegative integer in the contract), `totalAmountEur` (integer cents / 100, nonnegative), `topTargetCurrency` (nullable — `null` at zero conversions, the honest empty state); ties resolve to the alphabetically first code with one pass and a strict `>` over the Query's ascending sort-key order — no sort; the response carries NO cache headers of any kind.
- **The EUR-at-write-time conversion (`toEurCents`)** — integer cents: `from = EUR` → `Math.round(amount × 100)` directly (no rate lookup); otherwise through `rate(from→EUR)` from the same cached payload, rounded once by `roundMoney`.
- **The write-failure policy live** — the statistics step (BOTH the EUR conversion and the write) runs in one try/catch: a conversion never fails because of statistics; the write retries ×3 with an injectable backoff, transient attempts log `warn` through the request-scoped logger (the retry lines carry the request id), the final failure logs `error` and the 200 still goes out.
- **Tests** — 15 new (95 total): the `toEurCents` branches (including the no-rate-lookup EUR spy), the repository against the real dynamodb-local (transactional totals, the tie-break, the empty state, the retry warn counts, the exhausted-retry throw), the API shape with no cache headers, both still-200 failure paths, and the end-to-end persistence proof: `POST /api/convert` → `GET /api/stats` through the real database.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-12 12:37

### Added

- **`POST /api/convert`** — the conversion with the live cross-rate through the USD base: `rate` in full precision (verifiable math), `result` as the only rounded field, `rateTimestamp` with the §3 semantics (the rates-fetch time, not the conversion moment) validated as ISO 8601 in the contract; currency codes case-insensitive, normalized to uppercase.
- **`roundMoney()` (`src/lib/money.ts`)** — the single rounding place of the system: half-up to 2 decimal places computed from the **decimal string** via BigInt cents, never float multiplication (`1.005` rounds UP — the trap the naive `Math.round(x*100)/100` fails); whole numbers pass through (no decimal point in `toString()`); sub-1e-6 values round to the honest 0; non-finite, negative and oversized exponential inputs throw.
- **The conversion service (`src/conversion/`)** — both currencies validated against the ACTUAL supported list (the keys of the cached rates, rule 5); an unknown code → 422 `UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCY` with `params.code` and the interpolated message.
- **The Zod-key passthrough** — the central handler detects schema failures via `hasZodFastifySchemaValidationErrors` and passes `error.validation[0].message` through as the i18n `key` (the schema messages ARE keys, §3); unknown/default Zod messages fall back to the generic `invalidRequest` key instead of crashing the lookup.
- **The validation catalog live** — `amountNotPositive`, `amountTooLarge` (> 1e12), `amountTooManyDecimals` (a string-based decimal check, no float arithmetic), `invalidCurrencyCode` (`/^[A-Za-z]{3}$/`, not a length check), `sameCurrency` (after the uppercase normalization — `eur`/`EUR` is the same currency).
- **The honest zero** — a result may round to 0.00 (e.g. 0.01 of a weak currency into a strong one); decided with the human and covered by tests at the unit, service and API level.
- **Tests** — 29 new (80 total): the `roundMoney` boundary catalog (1.005, 0.005, 2.675, carries, whole numbers, long expansions, the throwing branches), the service math and error paths, and the full API validation catalog — every key triggered over HTTP, the 422 with `params.code`, the 502, the lowercase→UPPERCASE normalization and the OpenAPI presence.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-12 11:03

### Added

- **`GET /api/currencies`** — currency codes mapped to display names for the conversion selects; the response is the **intersection** of the OER currency names and the cached rates (only currencies that have a rate are listed — the list and the rates never diverge), keys sorted; `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`.
- **The names source** — `fetchCurrencyNames` through the single OER fetch pattern (the shared injectable fetch, timeout and Zod parsing); cached by the generic `createCachedSource<T>` with a 1-hour TTL and an independent stale fallback.
- **`RATE_PROVIDER_ERROR` (502)** — the error-model piece deferred from v0.3.0: an unreachable provider (no stale copy) is mapped by the central error handler to 502 in the unified shape; the `errors.rateProvider` translation existed since v0.2.0, so the catalog needed zero changes; covered by a catalog API test that triggers the 502 over HTTP.
- **The `buildApp` DI seam** — an optional `ratesProvider` override for route tests (rule 1 — the tests never touch the real OER client); `server.ts` unchanged.
- **Tests** — 9 new (51 total): the intersection semantics (both drop directions), the sorted keys, the stale-names fallback, the names-unavailable 502 path, the `/currencies.json` parsing branches, the endpoint happy path with the cache header and the 502 catalog test.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-12 05:58

### Added

- **The rates module (`src/rates/`)** — the openexchangerates client with an injectable fetch, a 5 s AbortController timeout and Zod parsing of the external response (the shape is never assumed); the key never appears in errors or logs.
- **The generic cache (`createCachedSource<T>`)** — in-memory, TTL 10 minutes, an injected clock for deterministic tests; concurrent callers share a single in-flight fetch; a failed refresh serves the stale copy with its original `fetchedAt`, a failed first fetch propagates.
- **The cross-rate provider** — every pair computed through the USD base (`rate(from→to) = usdRates[to] / usdRates[from]`, full precision); `rateTimestamp` = the moment the cached payload was fetched from OER (ISO 8601 UTC), honestly older under the stale fallback; the supported-currency list as the keys of the cached rates; module errors (`RateProviderUnavailableError` — the 502 of v0.4.0, `UnknownRateCurrencyError` — never a silent NaN).
- **Tests** — 19 new (42 total): the cache TTL/stale/deduplication behavior under fake time, the client parsing/timeout/missing-key branches, the cross-rate math and the provider error and age semantics.

### Changed

- **`GET /health`** — `ratesCacheAge` is now wired to the real rates cache (still `null` until the first fetch; the endpoint never triggers one).
- **`.env.example`** — adds `OER_API_KEY` (empty — a secret).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-12 05:44

### Added

- **i18n module (`src/i18n/`)** — EN/CS/SK translation files with the complete fixed key catalog (the backend errors including codes arriving in later versions, plus the frontend UI texts per Figma); statically imported (the future Lambda bundle has no files on disk).
- **`GET /api/init`** — the languages and all the translation trees at once; a strong SHA-256 ETag computed once per process, `Cache-Control: no-cache`, a matching `If-None-Match` gets `304 Not Modified` with an empty body.
- **No-fallback policy** — a missing translation or interpolation param fails immediately; it never resolves to the key itself, English, an empty string or a placeholder.
- **Tests** — 15 new (23 total): translation parity (missing AND extra keys, non-empty leaves, `{{param}}` placeholder parity across languages, every `ErrorKey` present), `formatEnglishMessage` behavior including all the throwing branches, the `/api/init` shape, the ETag stability, the 304/200 revalidation branches and the OpenAPI presence.

### Changed

- **The error `message` source** — the central error handler now builds messages from the EN translations via `formatEnglishMessage` (with `{{param}}` interpolation); the temporary `ENGLISH_MESSAGES` constants from v0.1.0 are removed.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-12 05:15

### Added

- **Project skeleton** — strict TypeScript on Node 22 (pinned via `.nvmrc`, `engines` and `engine-strict`), npm scripts (`dev`, `verify:api` = typecheck + lint + tests, `db:init`, `setup`, `openapi:export`), Prettier with tabs, ESLint (typescript-eslint, no `any`, no type assertions), `.editorconfig`.
- **Fastify application (`buildApp()`)** — the adapter architecture: all the logic in `src/app.ts`, `src/server.ts` is a thin local adapter with graceful shutdown; configuration read exclusively from env variables (native `--env-file`, no dotenv).
- **`GET /health`** — instance diagnostics: the version from `package.json`, process uptime, `ratesCacheAge` (null until the rates cache exists in v0.3.0).
- **The central error handler and the error model** — every error normalized into `{ error: { code, key, message, params? } }`: 404 `NOT_FOUND`, malformed JSON and an oversized body as `VALIDATION_ERROR`, unexpected errors as 500 `INTERNAL_ERROR` with no internals leaked; the full error logged with the request id.
- **Swagger UI at `/docs`** — the OpenAPI documentation generated from the Zod schemas in `src/schemas.ts` (single source of truth); the raw spec at `/docs/json`; `openapi.json` exported and committed as the contract artifact.
- **Observability baseline** — `X-Request-Id` (UUID) on every response, one structured log line per request (status, latency, URL without the query string), `debug` level locally / `info` in production.
- **Local DynamoDB environment** — docker-compose with dynamodb-local on :8002 (named volume, `user: root`), the idempotent `npm run db:init` (`scripts/create-local-table.ts`) and the one-command onboarding `npm run setup` (container + table + `.env`).
- **GitHub Actions CI** — the `api` job: `npm ci` → `verify:api` → the OpenAPI drift guard (re-export + `git diff --exit-code`), dynamodb-local as a service container; Dependabot for security updates only.
- **Tests (Vitest)** — 8 integration tests via `app.inject()` and dynamodb-local: the `/health` shape, every error branch of the handler (404/400/413/500 with no leak), the request-id uniqueness, the OpenAPI document, the `db:init` idempotence.

## [0.0.0] — 2026-06-12 04:15

### Added

- **Working rules (`CLAUDE.md`)** — the contract with the AI: 28 rules covering decision-making, the git flow, code quality, the error model, language discipline and the definition of done.
- **AI guardrails (`.claude/settings.json`)** — committed permissions (allow for routine read-only and test commands; deny for `.env` reads, deploy, remove and push) and a PostToolUse hook running the typecheck after every file edit.
- **Custom commands (`.claude/commands/`)** — `/diary` (a record into the AI collaboration diary) and `/review-api` (an adversarial pre-commit review targeting the domain traps).
- **Skills (`.claude/skills/`)** — six task-type procedures: `version-workflow`, `api-endpoint`, `error-code`, `dynamo-stats`, `fe-component`, `figma-to-scss`.
- **Documentation (`docs/`)** — `proposal.md` (the binding design and the roadmap 0.0.0 → 1.0.0) and `AI_SETUP.md` (the AI process and its reasoning).
- **AI collaboration diary (`AI_DIARY.md`)** — created on day one, with the record template in the file header.
- **Repo hygiene (`.gitignore`)** — secrets (`.env*` except `.env.example`), local AI permissions (`.claude/settings.local.json`), dependencies and build outputs.
